# Global logging properties.
# ------------------------------------------
# The set of handlers to be loaded upon startup.
# Comma-separated list of class names.
# (? LogManager docs say no comma here, but JDK example has comma.)
handlers=java.util.logging.FileHandler, java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Default global logging level.
# Loggers and Handlers may override this level
.level=INFO

# Loggers
# ------------------------------------------
# Loggers are usually attached to packages.
# Here, the level for each package is specified.
# The global level is used by default, so levels
# specified here simply act as an override.

# Handlers
# -----------------------------------------

# --- ConsoleHandler ---
# Override of global logging level
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=ALL 
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter

# --- FileHandler ---

# Naming style for the output file:
# (The output file is placed in the directory
# defined by the "user.home" System property.)
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern=%h/java%u.log

# Limiting size of output file in bytes:
java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit=50000

# Number of output files to cycle through, by appending an
# integer to the base file name:
java.util.logging.FileHandler.count=1

# Style of output (Simple or XML):
java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
